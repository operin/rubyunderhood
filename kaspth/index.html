<p>Hi, everyone! This is <a href="https://twitter.com/kaspth" title="Kasper Timm Hansen">@kaspth</a>. You may know me from <a href="https://t.co/Qn6QYLhMWw">rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com</a>, <a href="https://t.co/LNIBAhiQ26">dev.firmafon.com/blog</a>, or, just as likely, nothing at all üòÅ</p>
<p>Daytime gig is with <a href="https://twitter.com/Firmafon" title="Firmafon">@Firmafon</a>, while nighttime shindigs belong to <a href="https://twitter.com/rails" title="Ruby on Rails">@rails</a>.</p>
<p>I generally don‚Äôt plan that far ahead, but feel free to ask me questions in English to your hearts content üòé</p>
<p>10 minutes in, I‚Äôve already made my first mistake. Our blog is at <a href="https://t.co/kJ79bTW8BH">dev.firmafon.dk/blog</a>.</p>
<p>Only really dig in to Open Source on nights and weekends :)</p>
<p>Currently no sponsorships, no. <a href="https://t.co/MKyEyrkGAr">twitter.com/kirshatrov/sta‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Never did anything of note until I was a Google summer of code student for Rails. <a href="https://t.co/WM1fQVFa4c">twitter.com/gmile/status/6‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Then things went pretty quiet until I started helping out with Rails‚Äô Global ID repo mostly in August-October 2014.</p>
<p>Early 2015, I started watching the Rails repo, just to get a feel for things. About 2-3 weeks in, I began reviewing PRs.</p>
<p>Because of my long history with the Rails people (they knew to trust me), I was promoted to Rails‚Äô issues team.</p>
<p>Kept reviewing pull requests and made it to Rails‚Äô committers team June-July.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute to Rails, I‚Äôd say thoughtful feedback focusing on tuning PR readability is your best bet. Keep building trust!</p>
<p>Oh, I‚Äôd also add don‚Äôt try to win anything by it. I‚Äôm not aiming for core team or anything. The work is worthy in and of itself üòÅ</p>
<p>Why‚Äôs Poignant Guide was the first time I saw Ruby (ca. 2009). A year later, Rails for Zombies showed me Rails. <a href="https://t.co/3il70t9xSp">twitter.com/pinyslutty/sta‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN FOLKS <a href="https://t.co/TVJ85h5Yvm">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Craig Hockenberry‚Äôs App Development: The Missing Manual recommended Why‚Äôs Poignant Guide to Ruby. <a href="https://t.co/Ns8TGmyQhc">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>I thought for a long time iOS was the thing (too sucked in by the Mac blogosphere). Ruby was still there in the backseat.</p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt until I started deciding for myself. I realized just how much iOS development sucked, and how much more fun Ruby and the web was.</p>
<p>On a serious note: fuck no. Frameworks with batteries included all the way! <a href="https://t.co/IvK7isDQUw">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Just trying to get better at Ruby mostly. I hear good things about it though :)</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/BzpGdQADWJ">twitter.com/thetaktes/stat‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>By the way, Pheonix's model for Web Sockets were an inspiration to Action Cable ;)</p>
<p>Great! More Rails for the rest of us üòé

<p>Make software development exist ü§ì<a href="https://t.co/19fe4Gu221">twitter.com/nick_jastix/st‚Ä¶</a>1</p>
<p>Less cheeky: have no idea. Don‚Äôt think you choose your profession as much as your profession chooses you.</p>
<p>Which, partly means, I suck at choosing. For better or worse, most of my life has been drifting.</p>
<p>I was pretty staunch about not taking a formal CS degree. Already great at ‚Äúschool‚Äù, I wanted something were I was in charge.</p>
<p>Has anybody tried Turbolinks in their apps? We have an Angular setup, but would like to switch to less academic JS.</p>
<p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/Firmafon" title="Firmafon">@Firmafon</a> is a carrier, so just having software that is intuitive and works is a blessing for people.</p>
<p>In other words we‚Äôre not making an ambitious web application as Ember puts it üòÅ</p>
<p>Aww, that sucks. Are you just running without a JS framework? :) <a href="https://t.co/FBe0jYAph3">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>The Leprechaun got out of the console üòÅ<a href="https://t.co/to6sECvGQ4">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a>4</p>
<p>Haven‚Äôt looked very much into them. I have heard Go being thrown around a lot lately for what that‚Äôs worth. <a href="https://t.co/bmPaMGDxoS">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>About Lisp, I've watched most of 80's MIT's computing intro lectures: <a href="https://t.co/MAp4Fk3zWF">ocw.mit.edu/courses/electr‚Ä¶</a> ‚Äî holds up well!</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/JLhS9EzRjL">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Ah, really! What was the project? :)</p>
<p>(Yes, I have a 2013 student t-shirt and a 2015 mentor one)</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/GiQZ1KIW7V">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>I like Turbolinks partly because it's not meant as a blackhole.</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/3V7rF91NiS">twitter.com/artofhuman/sta‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Facebook and Google always have a surplus of programmers to throw at React and Angular, while Basecamp still keeps it to 10-12.</p>
<p>That matters a lot for our team of 4 developers :)</p>
<p>Jim Weirich gave a talk about the SICP book from the course:</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/Vfqw6bPtK7">confreaks.tv/videos/gogaruc‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Well, the first two &quot;mind-blowing&quot; chapters :)</p>
<p>Every time I hear that I think about Shopify: <a href="https://t.co/CctwXfRGKo">shopify.com/technology/156‚Ä¶</a>.</p>
<p>The end result sounds far nicer :)</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/VEslYRp4vL">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Nice! :D</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/cmH545u3p5">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Our app has enough complexity elsewhere ü§ì
<a href="https://t.co/VEslYRp4vL">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a>L</p>
<h2>–°—Ä–µ–¥–∞ <small>17 —Ç–≤–∏—Ç–æ–≤</small></h2>
<p>Yes, ‚Äúfun‚Äù! You get way more cred for using one of those frameworks. Turbolinks is boring. <a href="https://t.co/LgRtDhUZLv">twitter.com/common_disease‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>RT <a href="https://twitter.com/listochkin" title="–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –õ–∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–∫–∏–Ω">@listochkin</a>: .<a href="https://twitter.com/rubyunderhood" title="Ruby developer">@rubyunderhood</a> Take a look at Pjax. Here <a href="https://twitter.com/StarrHorne" title="Starr Horne">@StarrHorne</a> talks about their experience and why they picked Pjax over TL https:/<a href="https://t.co/3vajNvJHkA">confreaks.tv/videos/madison‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Funny how many say they remove Turbolinks from new apps, but I haven‚Äôt seen any mention --skip-turbolinks üòÅ</p>
<p>Yeah, from what I‚Äôve seen it is less complex. <a href="https://t.co/zSaZUuU2TG">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>minitest-focus is pretty neat. I usually go for byebug if I need a debugger. <a href="https://t.co/gJVm24l4q2">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Otherwise being the designated Rails upgrader at our company, I‚Äôd say the fewer dependencies the better.</p>
<p>We just switched to Rails 4.2 Monday, and nearly got caught in a virtuous cycle of dependency upgrade forcing another upgrade :/</p>
<p>Depends on how you like your Monday‚Äôs, I guess.</p>
<p>Personally I can only stand a 24 hour dose in a day <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pun">#pun</a></p>
<p>method_source is also cool (which pry uses I believe). Have never been a big pry guy. What do you like about it? :) <a href="https://t.co/mIHAbSaQD2">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>My pedigree is no degree üòÅ</p>
<p>How much of school is self funded in Russia? In Denmark the government pays all.<a href="https://t.co/qCb7mvGZuh">twitter.com/common_disease‚Ä¶</a>h</p>
<p>I was drifting toward university too because I‚Äôd taken dogma as fact: ‚Äúyou got good grades, you <em>ought</em> to go to university‚Äù. Bah, humbug!</p>
<p>Good point. It‚Äôs not a direct apples to apples comparison.</p>
<p>Public framework usually beats homegrown. <a href="https://t.co/gEnk8UMCt3">twitter.com/common_disease‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm even more esoteric than DHH here. I use Chocolat, which does the job and looks like a Mac app. <a href="https://t.co/O0PpM5tfjO">twitter.com/nick_jastix/st‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Do use Vim for commit messages, so I get trained slowly.</p>
<p>Thanks! I‚Äôll look into it :) <a href="https://t.co/TMNKJ2xL2n">twitter.com/listochkin/sta‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>They‚Äôd save time if they did, I think üòÅ<a href="https://t.co/gOTUBC4FLY">twitter.com/fat0troll/stat‚Ä¶</a>Y</p>
<h2>–ß–µ—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–≥ <small>22 —Ç–≤–∏—Ç–∞</small></h2>
<p>Love Minitest to bits and can‚Äôt stand Rspec :D</p>
<p>Flame on! <a href="https://t.co/IX6nSITBeH">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Dang it, we forgot to get those in for Rails 5 ü§ì<a href="https://t.co/r5GLChjOWJ">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a>J</p>
<p>Convention over configuration triumphs again! <a href="https://t.co/L7BjRIC2eG">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Hope you like it. I‚Äôm not very advanced with editors.</p>
<p>Typing things out by hand doesn‚Äôt need to be :) <a href="https://t.co/R8ano9WLRm">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Sounds like you made the right choice üëå<a href="https://t.co/djxWSGdTQh">twitter.com/vassilevsky/st‚Ä¶</a>h</p>
<p>Also, don‚Äôt get me started on grades.</p>
<p>Fancy pseudo science people sorter that can do no wrong. <a href="https://t.co/djxWSGdTQh">twitter.com/vassilevsky/st‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>If I recall correctly grades were invented in late 18th century. Why haven‚Äôt we ‚Äúdisrupted‚Äù them yet?</p>
<p>/rant</p>
<p>Mostly interested in rounding out my stack at the moment. I still suck at finding stuff in logs for instance. <a href="https://t.co/TmKgVA78YG">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>What I‚Äôm saying is: I already have one area mapped out and don‚Äôt care much for differing perspectives right now. In time that will change.</p>
<p>Interesting. I should look more into it. <a href="https://t.co/aCKe3C12vO">twitter.com/common_disease‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Also if you‚Äôre reading this and mainly use <code>puts</code> for debugging? Don‚Äôt fret!</p>
<p>Lots of people and it‚Äôs fine üòé</p>
<p>To me, byebug covers that just fine.</p>
<p>I get tired of typing <code>continue</code> to step instead of just <code>s</code>. <a href="https://t.co/1mHcF3mTIt">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>But we could be on an old version, ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>
<p>Given that it‚Äôs tiny, it should be much easier to grok too :) <a href="https://t.co/TkzRSqcKMN">twitter.com/jastkand/statu‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Ha! That rings true to me üòÅ<a href="https://t.co/7AUnY3yIlP">twitter.com/ZaZooBred/stat‚Ä¶</a>P</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to be mean to people who have degrees, but usually people with PH.D.s get touted as the ultimate achievers by society.</p>
<p>Or as reaching it is a milestone. I just won‚Äôt accept that.</p>
<p>Doesn‚Äôt feel like a Mac app to me.</p>
<p>I know what that sounds like coming from a web developer üò±<a href="https://t.co/8fmdjrsPDW">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta‚Ä¶</a>W</p>
<p>That, and hackability isn‚Äôt a selling point for me.</p>
<p>I just want boring old software that works. <a href="https://t.co/OmVlgKlS0P">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Ha! That‚Äôs pretty great üòÅ<a href="https://t.co/pGhSgTN4Mo">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta‚Ä¶</a>o</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt know about that one :) <a href="https://t.co/FGHTlymcj4">twitter.com/anton_davydov/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>My point wasn‚Äôt to find an alternative. It‚Äôs no one has been sought.</p>
<p>(Also fuck no, that would be horrible.) <a href="https://t.co/vbsxLzLwJq">twitter.com/common_disease‚Ä¶</a></p>
<h2>–ü—è—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ <small>15 —Ç–≤–∏—Ç–æ–≤</small></h2>
<p>Nothing wrong with that! I‚Äôd just like to <em>try</em> to keep it to one area at the moment. <a href="https://t.co/kUU3hJU14C">twitter.com/rainrb/status/‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve demanded a raise before. Unfortunately, I, not the exception, got fired. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pun">#pun</a> <a href="https://t.co/0ivEZTwwLx">twitter.com/ZaZooBred/stat‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Agreed, and that‚Äôs usually orthogonal to education. <a href="https://t.co/6M7RnXlOkn">twitter.com/ZaZooBred/stat‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Conventions and standards trumps isomorphism by far. <a href="https://t.co/u1EX4HBk6o">twitter.com/kirylkiryl/sta‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Saw a demo of Volt once, the example controller was a grabbag.</p>
<p>That part felt like a huge step back to me.</p>

<p>RT <a href="https://twitter.com/Shiroginne" title="Mac Shifford">@Shiroginne</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/rubyunderhood" title="Ruby developer">@rubyunderhood</a> -&gt; Does every young Danish boy/girl want to be a programmer? üòé</p>
<p>I think much of that movement is a ruse from on high.</p>
<p>All they talk about is the dollars they can gain. <a href="https://t.co/2TntgyyySR">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta‚Ä¶</a></p>
<p>Code is terrible for most people. It‚Äôs a horrible interface to gaining intuitive rationality.</p>
<p>My clarity of thinking improved massively once programming clicked.</p>
<p>But gaining that through code is not for most people.</p>
<p>We should have something better than code. I have no idea what that will be, but I‚Äôm fascinated by Bret Victor‚Äôs research.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs trying to unlock other ways of thinking by shifting our perspective. And whips up amazing demos üòé</p>
<p>No. Likely because the Danish government hasn‚Äôt figured out how to make money off those people yet. <a href="https://t.co/ziHuE514nB">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta‚Ä¶</a></p>
